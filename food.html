        <h1>Food of Tel Aviv</h1>
        <p>Home to the most delicious food I've ever had.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="salad-image">

    </div>

    <div class="old-man text">
        <a id="old-man"></a>
        <h2>Old Man By The Sea</h2>
        <p>This place was one of my favorites spots this summer. As you are sitting on the port in Jaffa, endless "salads" appear in fron of you. All you can eat for about $17 is a deal you can't beat. You leave completely stuffed, but very satisfied.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="juicery-image">
        <img src="images/juicery.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="juicery text">
        <a id="juicery"></a>
        <h2>Juicery</h2>
        <p>This place doesn't look like anything special and there isn't even a menu. But, when you go up and talk to the owner he designs the perfect smoothie or acai bowl you didn't even know you needed. Perfect place to go after the beach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gabay-image">
        <img src="images/gabay.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="gabay text">
        <a id="falafal"></a>
        <h2>Falafel Gabay</h2>
        <p>What would Israel be without some classic falafel and shwarama? Gabay is the perfect place to get both. Their pita is sooo fresh and the meat is incredible. I highly recommend trying their specialty sandwich for a burst of flavors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="shakshukia-image">
        <img src="images/shakshukia.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="shakshukia text">
        <a id="shakshukia"></a>
        <h2>Shakshukia</h2>
        <p>Shakshukia is home to the best shakshuka in Tel Aviv. They have so many unique twists on the classic dish and serve it with a huge side of bread to soak up all the good sauces. If you've never tried shakshuka I suggest trying it now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="moon-image">
        <img src="images/moon.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="moon text">
        <a id="moon"></a>
        <h2>Moon Sushi Bar</h2>
        <p>Moon was definitely a treat. Although a little on the pricier side, the ambiance is a must experience. They have a huge menu so definitly look before you go and get a lot of different things to try.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tamara-image">
        <img src="images/tamara.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="tamara text">
        <a id="tamara"></a>
        <h2>Tamara</h2>
        <p>Before my trip to Israel I had never been one to order tart yogurt at a frozen yogurt shop. However, I don't think I can go back after experiencing Tamara and the array of toppings they have. It tastes fresh and delicious. Great for an extra hot day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="shuk-image">
        <img src="images/shuk.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="shuk text">
        <a id="shuk"></a>
        <h2>The Carmel Market</h2>
        <p>The Carmel Market is my favorite place in Tel Aviv. Home to street food, I have truly never had more delicious or more unique dishes. The shopping is amazing and beware of going on a Friday before Shabbat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lashuk-image">
        <img src="images/la shuk.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="lashuk text">
        <a id="lashuk"></a>
        <h2>La Shuk</h2>
        <p>This is the perfect place for a Saturday brunch. I mean just look at the color of that eggs benedict. In the center of Dizengoff circle, you are at the center of everything. The food and vibes are immaculate to say the least.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benedict-image">
        <img src="images/benedict.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="benedict text">
        <a id="benedict"></a>
        <h2>Benedict</h2>
        <p>The most important thing to know about Benedict is that it is open until 4AM. The pancakes are so fluffy and of course the eggs benedict is fantastic. This is a great place for brunch or the eat brunch in the middle of the night.</p>
