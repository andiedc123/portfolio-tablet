		<p>Hi, my name is Andie Carroll and I can't wait to tell you about my past summer in Tel Aviv. 
			But first, here is a little bit about me! 
			I'm a Junior at the University of Michigan studying UX Design and Economics.
			I'm from New Canaan, CT and live with my mom and sister.

		<p>Some of my hobbies include skiing, hiking, and cooking. I love the outdoors and became obsessed with long walks during quarantine.
			I love hanging out with my friends and I hope to travel around the world through out my life.

			Fun fact about me is that before I went to Israel this summer I spent the last 11 years going to sleep away camp with my best friends in Penn Yan, NY. Here they are to the left.
